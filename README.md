# NLP_SpellChecker
Used Unigram and Bigram models for spellcheck

Training a language model to build a spell checker. 
In particular, implementing part of a noisy-channel model for spelling correction.  
At test time a sentence with exactly one typing error is given as input.
The correction that gets highest likelihood under the noisy-channel model, using the language model as the prior is chosen.

As a part of a assignment, the rest of the code structure has been provided. The uploaded models are only the final pieces, the logic models.
